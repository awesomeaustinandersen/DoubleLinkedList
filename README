The purpose of this program is to create a data structure where one can traverse the list going backwards and forwards. The program
takes a generic type which allows the user to create a Double-Linked List for any specific type.

Note: This program is currently UNFINISHED. It is still a work in progress, and as such, likely won't work if you try to create a 
Double-Linked List

To run:
Compile the files - javac DoubleLinkedList.java
                    java DoubleLinkedList
